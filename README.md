# Guess-The-Number
<p>This repository contains a "Guess the Random Number" game that has been implemented in C++.</p>
<p>The game challenges players to guess a number that is randomly generated between 1 and 100. The number of guesses provided are also limited. It includes features such as providing hints to the player if their guess is above or below the desired number, and it also keeps track of the number of attempts made. </p>
<p>This project is a great example of how to use random number generation and basic user input/output handling in C++. It's an engaging and interactive way to practice coding while having fun.</p>
